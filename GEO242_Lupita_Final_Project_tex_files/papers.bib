abstract = {A hybrid global search algorithm is used to solve the nonlinear problem of calculating slip amplitude, rake, risetime, and rupture time on a finite fault. Thirty-five strong motion velocity records are inverted by this method over the frequency band from 0.1 to 1.0 Hz for the Northridge earthquake. Four regions of larger-amplitude slip are identified: one near the hypocenter at a depth of 17 km, a second west of the hypocenter at about the same depth, a third updip from the hypocenter at a depth of 10 km, and a fourth updip from the hypocenter and to the northwest. The results further show an initial fast rupture with a velocity of 2.8 to 3.0 km/s followed by a slow termination of the rupture with velocities of 2.0 to 2.5 km/s. The initial energetic rupture phase lasts for 3 s, extending out 10 km from the hypocenter. Slip near the hypocenter has a short risetime of 0.5 s, which increases to 1.5 s for the major slip areas removed from the hypocentral region. The energetic rupture phase is also shown to be the primary source of high-frequency radiation (1–15 Hz) by an inversion of acceleration envelopes. The same global search algorithm is used in the envelope inversion to calculate high-frequency radiation intensity on the fault and rupture time. The rupture timing from the low- and high-frequency inversions is similar, indicating that the high frequencies are produced primarily at the mainshock rupture front. Two major sources of high-frequency radiation are identified within the energetic rupture phase, one at the hypocenter and another deep source to the west of the hypocenter. The source at the hypocenter is associated with the initiation of rupture and the breaking of a high-stress-drop asperity and the second is associated with stopping of the rupture in a westerly direction.},

abstract = {The Mw 6.7 Northridge earthquake occurred on January 17, 1994, beneath the San Fernando Valley. Two seismicity clusters, located 25 km to the south and 35 km to the north-northwest, preceded the mainshock by 7 days and 16 hours, respectively. The mainshock hypocenter was relatively deep, at 19 km depth in the lower crust. It had a thrust faulting focal mechanism with a rake of 100° on a fault plane dipping 35° to the south-southwest and striking N75°W. Because the mainshock did not rupture the surface, its association with surficial geological features remains difficult to resolve. Nonetheless, its occurrence reemphasized the seismic hazard of concealed faults associated with the contractional deformation of the Transverse Ranges. The Northridge earthquake is part of the temporal increase in earthquake activity in the Los Angeles area since 1970. The mainshock was followed by an energetic aftershock sequence. Eight aftershocks of M ≥ 5.0 and 48 aftershocks of 4 ≤ M ≤ 5 occurred between January 17 and September 30, 1994. The aftershocks extend over most of the western San Fernando Valley and Santa Susana Mountains. They form a diffuse spatial distribution around the mainshock rupture plane, illuminating a previously unmapped thrust ramp, extending from 7–10 km depth into the lower crust to a depth of 23 km. No flattening of the aftershock distribution is observed near its bottom. At shallow depths, above 7–10 km, the thrust ramp is topped by a dense distribution of aftershock hypocenters bounded by some of the surficial faults. The dip of the ramp increases from east to west. The west side of the aftershock zoae is characterized by a dense, steeply dipping, and north-northeast striking planar cluster of aftershocks that exhibited mostly thrust faulting. These events coincided with the Gillibrand Canyon lateral ramp. Along the east side of the aftershock zone the aftershocks also exhibited primarily thrust faulting focal mechanisms. The focal mechanisms of the aftershocks were dominated by thrust faulting in the large aftershocks, with some strike-slip and normal faulting in the smaller aftershocks. The 1971 San Fernando and the 1994 Northridge earthquakes ruptured partially abutting fault surfaces on opposite sides of a ridge. Both earthquakes accommodated north-south contractional deformation of the Transverse Ranges. The two earthquakes differ primarily in the dip direction of the faults and the depth of faulting. The 1971 north-northeast trend of left-lateral faulting (Chatsworth trend) was not activated in 1994.},

    abstract = {The 17 January 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake was a watershed event with far‐reaching societal and scientific impacts. The earthquake, which occurred in the early days of both broadband seismic networks and the Internet, spurred advances in seismic monitoring, real‐time systems, and development of data products. Motivated by the 30th anniversary of the earthquake, we present a brief retrospective of the earthquake and its impact, and reconsider both ground motions and the aftershock distribution using modern tools and the best‐available data. With improvements in instrumentation and analysis methodology, recent earthquakes continue to reveal the increasing complexity of ground motions, fault systems, and earthquake ruptures. Even in the absence of data from state‐of‐the‐art instrumentation, a retrospective consideration of ground‐motion data from the Northridge earthquake reveals complexities beyond what could be characterized (and modeled) 30 yr ago. Aftershock relocations for both the 1971 Sylmar and 1994 Northridge earthquakes also reveal an updated view of fault complexity. Our study does provide a cautionary tale regarding legacy data sets and research results that are not easily accessible, which can result in discrepancies between catalog data and products from the best available science. We also briefly describe outreach products produced as a part of the anniversary commemoration.},

abstract = {Earthquake aftershock sequences have been found to approximately satisfy three empirical scaling relations: i) the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude scaling, ii) Båth's law for the difference in the magnitude of a mainshock and its largest aftershock, and iii) the modified Omori's law for the temporal decay of aftershock rates. The three laws are incorporated to give a generalized Omori's law for aftershock decay rates that depend on several parameters specific for each given seismogenic region. It is shown that the characteristic time c, first introduced in the modified Omori's law, is no longer a constant but scales with a lower magnitude cutoff and a mainshock magnitude. The generalized Omori's law is tested against earthquake catalogs for the aftershock sequences of the Landers, Northridge, Hector Mine, and San Simeon earthquakes.},

    abstract = {We determined the source process of the 1994 Northridge earthquake in relation to the aftershock mechanisms. To study the source complexity of the mainshock, we inverted the P and SH waveforms recorded by the IRIS and IDA/IRIS networks, using the method of Kikuchi and Kanamori (1991) in which the rupture is represented by a series of discrete subevents with varying mechanisms. The waveforms show that the rupture consisted of several subevents with about 2 sec in between. Our solution consists of three subevents with essentially the same mechanism, viz., strike, dip, and slip of 130°, 42°, and 116°, respectively. The first subevent occurred at a depth of about 19 km, followed after 2 sec by the second and largest subevent at a depth of 17 km and the third subevent again 2 sec after the second at a depth of about 13 km. The total moment from the body waves of this sequence is about 1.1 × 1026 dyne · cm (Mw = 6.6) with a source duration of 7 sec.The large depths of these subevents explain the lack of any surface rupture. Furthermore, the upward propagation of the subevents is consistent with the depth of the hypocenter and the distribution of the aftershocks, which are shallower and more northerly than the mainshock hypocenter.The aftershocks were analyzed using data from the TERRAscope network. We inverted short-period surface waves to determine the moment tensor for 70 events with Mw \&gt; 3.5. The aftershocks can be grouped into three regions based on the mechanisms: the eastern part of the aftershock zone, where we find thrust events with mechanisms very similar to the main event; a central area with predominantly strike-slip events; and an area to the west, where we find oblique thrust events but with more northerly P axes than in the eastern region. This distribution suggests that the fault system on which the Northridge earthquake occurred is segmented and that the extent of the Northridge rupture is controlled by a change in geometry of the fault. We find a high stress drop (270 bar) for the mainshock; we propose that the changes in the fault geometry prevented a slip pulse from propagating, thereby causing a high ratio of slip-to-rupture length.},
